# 🤖 PredictiveAgent - AI-Powered Industrial Monitoring

## Overview

PredictiveAgent is an innovative AI-powered industrial monitoring application that combines the trending concept of **AI Agents** with **predictive maintenance** for industrial equipment. This application addresses the critical challenge of unplanned equipment downtime, which costs manufacturers $1.4 trillion annually according to recent industry reports.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Industrial facilities face significant challenges with:
- **Unplanned Equipment Downtime**: Unexpected failures leading to production losses
- **Reactive Maintenance**: Fixing equipment after it breaks rather than preventing failures
- **High Maintenance Costs**: Over-maintenance or emergency repairs
- **Safety Risks**: Equipment failures can pose serious safety hazards
- **Data Overload**: Difficulty in processing and acting on vast amounts of sensor data

## 💡 Solution: AI Agents for Predictive Maintenance

PredictiveAgent leverages multiple specialized AI agents to continuously monitor industrial equipment and predict failures before they occur:

### 🤖 AI Agents
1. **Thermal Monitor Agent**: Detects temperature anomalies and overheating patterns
2. **Vibration Analysis Agent**: Identifies mechanical wear and bearing issues
3. **Maintenance Scheduler Agent**: Optimizes maintenance timing and resource allocation

### 🔧 Key Features
- **Real-time Equipment Monitoring**: Live dashboard showing equipment status, temperature, vibration levels
- **Predictive Analytics**: AI-powered failure prediction with days-to-failure estimates
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Specific maintenance actions suggested by AI agents
- **Alert System**: Real-time notifications for critical equipment conditions
- **Performance Metrics**: Track downtime reduction, cost savings, and prediction accuracy

## 🚀 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with modern CSS3
- **Styling**: Responsive design with gradient backgrounds and card layouts
